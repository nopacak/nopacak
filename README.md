I'm Nikolina: a mom of two 👩‍👧‍👦, avid traveler ✈️, dog lover 🐶, baller ⛹🏻‍♀️, yogi 🧘🏻‍♀️ and a tad bit of a nerd 🤓.

Currently pursuing BSc Computer Science at Goldsmiths College, University of London with specialization in Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence while working as an RPA Consultant at [Robotiq.ai](https://robotiq.ai/). Let's connect on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nikolina-robotiq/)!
